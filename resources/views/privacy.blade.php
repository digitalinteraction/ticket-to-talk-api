        <p>
            University of Newcastle Upon Tyne (“Newcastle University”, “we”, “us”), the owner of [Ticket to Talk], a mobile application (the “App”, or "Service"), recognizes the importance of your privacy. Therefore, we have created this Privacy Policy so that you know how we use and disclose your information when you make it available to us.

      <p>
        We may collect non-personally identifiable information, such as IP host address, pages viewed, device type, duration and frequency of uses or other data, and may aggregate any information collected in a manner which does not identify any individual (“Aggregate Information”). Aggregate Information obtained in connection with the Service may be intermingled with and used by us in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Service, including both offline and online sources.

      <p>
        As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each service you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as “clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a service’s server. Clickstream data can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the service from which you linked to the Service. We may collect and use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Service, how visitors navigate throughout the Service and how we may tailor our pages to better meet the needs of visitors. This information will be used to improve our Service. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and aggregated, and will not intentionally contain any personal information. We may also use this aggregated data in order to conduct academic research studies. As a result of these academic research studies we may publish the anonymous aggregated data we have outlined.
