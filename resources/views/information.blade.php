                Open Lab at Newcastle University is conducting research into how technology can be used to support conversations between younger people and people living with dementia. This study will explore experiences of this interaction by using the Ticket to Talk application and other activities, and then use these experiences to understand how to create further supportive technologies.

            <p>
                Younger relatives of people with dementia often face difficulties in conversation, with one of the biggest barriers in conversation being a lack of mutual topics of interest. With your use of Ticket to Talk you can help us gain a better understanding of familiesâ€™ experiences with intergenerational interaction and how we can help support it. With our new understanding on how families like yourselves manage this interaction we can create better supportive technologies to promote more positive conversations and relationships within families.

            <p>
                You can participate by using Ticket to Talk to collect photos, sounds, and YouTube videos and use these as prompts in conversation. If you agree to take part then we would use the data you collect to understand how different types of media are used to support conversation. We would do this by observing what types of media you are creating, along with how long you use different types of Tickets in conversation.
