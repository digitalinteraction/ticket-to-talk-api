This is an API for the Ticket to Talk application. The application handles creating accounts for people with dementia
that allows family and friends to add a collection of 'Tickets' (pictures, sounds, and YouTube videos), based on the
person with dementia's life. These tickets can then be used to help encourage and bridge gaps in conversation.

Getting Started

To use the application all endpoints except Login and Register require an API Key as a parameter. To get an API Key you
must first register and account and the key will be sent to you.
